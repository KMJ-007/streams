or one can say try to catch the signals, but there is high chance that one will fail, because rather than catching signals we catch the anti signals, because they are the easiest one to fall for, it’s like when signal is propagated to many times over the network, it looses it’s value and it becomes anti signal, it’s anti signal in disguise of signal."},"thoughts/Automating-Call-Center":{"title":"Automating Call Center","links":[],"tags":["seed","idea"],"content":"i know few friends who do job at call center, at late night, many of them
