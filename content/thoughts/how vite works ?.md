my go to for most js related project is vite, from when i got introduced, i don't ever think about webpack or other things, but i always have thought, how and where the magic is happening, at the very end, browser only understands three things, html, css, javascript, they don't know what the hell is react, typescript and all other frameworks, so how this magic happens,

this will be great rabbit hole to explore, will learn a lot of things

guy here tries to explain this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_edImKoEt8

all transplior and compiler, babel, esbuild, webpack, rollup, forward and backward compatibility, bundling etc..., there are lot of things which we hear and ignore them thinking they are mostly buzzword or jargons
