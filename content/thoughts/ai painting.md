thinking about creating and selling ai art this summer, to get new experience and for fun!


some uncommon and attention seeking genre which i am thinking which have high probability of selling:

- sci-fiction and futurism
	- totally one for nerds and sounds and sees cool
- rizz and little but not full adult kind of things
	- rizz should drip out and it should tease the fuck out of the viewer
