wtf is bare metal ?

computer that talks directly does mouth to mouth communication with hardware, no lipstick, no makeup anything in between, no os, nothing, application directly uses all the resource it needs,

can i call my laptop bare metal ?

Yes, you can refer to your laptop as a "bare metal" system if you are running applications directly on the laptop's hardware without any virtualization or operating system layer in between.

Most regular laptops run an operating system like Windows, macOS, or Linux. In that case, the OS manages the hardware resources and acts as an abstraction layer between the applications and the bare metal components like CPU, RAM, storage etc.

However, if you have configured your laptop to boot directly into an application or service without going through a full operating system, then it can be considered a bare metal setup. Some possible bare metal use cases on a laptop include:

1. Booting into a lightweight embedded environment to run a specific application with direct hardware access.
2. Using the laptop as a hardware development/testing platform by booting into a bare metal hypervisor.
3. Running scientific/technical computing workloads that bypass the OS for maximum performance.
4. Installing a bare metal server operating system like FreeBSD, FreeRTOS etc. on the laptop.

So in summary, while most standard consumer laptops don't run in a bare metal configuration out-of-the-box, it is possible to set them up that way for specific use cases requiring direct hardware control and access. As long as there is no OS virtualizing the hardware, you can describe your laptop as a "bare metal" system.
