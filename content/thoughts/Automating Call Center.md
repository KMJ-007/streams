i know few friends who do job at call center, at late night, many of them just sell insurance and other things in countries like uk and usa, despite lack of communication skill they are able to, i think using AI we can automate this whole process with more accuracy and higher chances of accuracy, but don't want to exploit this, just want to do for fun, just need to give calling ability, text to speech, feeding back what the response was in to the model, and giving response back!

calling friend and making prank in local language would be fun idea
