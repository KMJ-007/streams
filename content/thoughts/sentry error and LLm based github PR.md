this is going to be great project, give access to the your github repo, give api access to the sentry, bot will see the errors from the sentry and will automatically create the github PR for you which fixes the error, this small small are really simple but are overlooked lot of time

plz write a blog if you end up doing this, will be helpful to the other people
