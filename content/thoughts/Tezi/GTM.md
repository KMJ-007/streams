GTM strategy for [[thoughts/Tezi/index|Tezi]]

So first needs to pickup the one storefront which have already most of the customer of DTC and highly customisable,

Shopify seems great fit for this, we already published two plugins on the shopify, and shopify provides great way to integrate and get things done,

For our B2B approach, let's build basic feature standalone plugins, getting initial customers, and then combining all those in one single dashboard, in this way we can execute things and build things one upon another, our main goal is to achieving sales agent level feature parity, so we can start combining both online and offline and then we go for more specific to experiance store and start solving offline market problems, and seeing how retailers are reacting to this, and then going to provide omnichannel experience,

two parts:

- TezBrand
- TezAgent

TezBrand:

following feature as standalone plugins needed to develop and then creating ecosystem of plugins which work together in beautiful fashion:

each and every following plugin itself has lot of small small features and all of the following are required to operate B2B sales operation 

- onboarding and approving new customers and providing registration forms
- Customize prices for specific customers groups
	- Customize prices for each product of specific customers
- wholesale/Discounts based on purchase volume/ leader pricing
	- Limit customers' purchases by quantity and amount
- sales representative login and manual order creation
	- **Customer Record Creation:** Sales agents will have the ability to create customer records directly via SparkLayer (useful for sales agents on the road or at trade shows).    
	- **Price Modification:** We're introducing the ability to adjust prices in real-time
	- **Commission Reporting:** we'll be releasing basic reporting on tracking sales agent commissions
	- **Access History and Order Overview:** Sales agents will be able to view the most recently accessed accounts and orders across all customers.
	- **User Experience Improvements:** We'll be separating the sales agent roles from customer group setup, allowing sales agents to place orders more seamlessly.
	- **Customer Buying Behaviour:** The system will list the most frequently bought products per customer, assisting in sales and marketing efforts.
- TezBrand and TezAgent integration
TezAgent:
- Agent's onboarding, his profiling
- his credit score, and past performance and other things
- once agent is onboard on the tezagent, he will start seeing the active brand's, and it's incentive, and he can create the request, then brand will approve the agent 
- then he can start his offline marketing, and once he receive the orders, he can create that order on tezbrand and brand will see the order created by agent by order
