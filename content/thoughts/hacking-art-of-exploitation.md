just learning programming and other hacking things from book

will work as my dump

#### Notes:

objdump: it is good tool to examine binaries

example:
```bash
objdump -D a.out | grep -A20 _main 
```
give me all disassemble code in that find me 20 lines after _main function


fuck!!!

gdb has some issues on installation on m1 chips, i was not expecting this

there is alternative i think lldb or something similar

maybe i end up fixing it
