i think now i have wasted lots of time on random things, it's time to get better at my craft, plus i need to build personal branding also, with pulling some money, and automating things!

i have knowledge about many things, but actually knowing the neaty greaty of the things is different game all together,

so here's the plan:

1. picking up any good modal, research paper, and finding out really simple actual use case, which we can be monetizable, we are not going to build full fledge sass, we are not going to build super app or anything, the idea is which thing work out we never know, (we are going full on linux philosophy "Do One Thing And Do It Well.")
2. after picking up, creating very sexy trust worthy landing page with waiting list, launching it, with all the use case, SEO proofed and appealing site, pushing it out in the world, 
3. creating simple ui/app frontend, which is super simple and even if user wants to get confused it's very hard for them, cause there are not that many things, and hooking up with the backend(we are going full on modal labs this time, cause i am able to see huge roi in skill to everything, and cost effective to my pocket), this can be different app also or can be in the site itself!
4. putting simple payment link, yes without this we aren't shipping anything, we are going to make money, stop whoever can, nahi baatna free mai chije
5. launch!

this whole thing shouldn't take more than 2 days(ship fast bro or you are gay!)

rules:
1. how stupid the idea feels we are going to build it, no need to validated it or others have build it or not, we don't care, we ship it, and think after that, cause thinking about that and debating that thing for 2 days is waste i can ship it in 2 days
2. remember rule 1

we are going to use lots of AI's help in frontend cause i suck at design but in the backend we are not going to use, cause i want to build my intuition!
