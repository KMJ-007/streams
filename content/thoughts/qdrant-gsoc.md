wanted to contribute to open source and with rust it is going to more awesome!

so 18th march is the date to send the mail,

before that i need to polish and work on few things to incerase my probability of getting selected for this 

basic principle  is show don't tell, giving them link to view the work then telling them i did this or that is more important

first i need to complete two blogs:

- nodejs oberservability using signoz
- how we increased the pdf creation time on client side using webworker and some wasm experiments
- rust based another project i need to work on(maybe multi threaded web crawler?) (and if i combine the webcrawler project with wasm and give the real time demo then it would be more awesome)
