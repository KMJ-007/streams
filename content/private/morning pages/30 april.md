so from tomorrow there will be new ritual, not picking up phone untill i am ready for the day, after completing all the chores i am only allowed to pickup my phone, so my routine don't get fucked up!

i am going to gym everyday i think which i need to continue, and i am also getting more focused on the work, just the problem is not able to get rusty, 10 to 12 is perfect time, but i get sleepy after eating food, or i end up my time chatting with friends, i thought i am going to  get lost in her, but this guys are taking my time which is not worth it, this time is either for her or no one, rusty is there to help me in getting distracted, problem is there is very low friction in randomly chatting with friends, will still try to do some permutation and combination to see how this works out, my overall routine is good, i just to need to get more strict and follow it,

other than that she posted photo on the social media, and i think i have good taste in people, but let's see how this whole story goes or ends, i am still optimist about the whole situation, i need to get more focused and live in the moment with rough idea of my future direction, and i need to honer my craft!

let's go to gym and start the day!
