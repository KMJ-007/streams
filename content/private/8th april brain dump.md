few things are going in my mind right now, i want to write this in structured manner but it will make it little hard for me to express, 

 i am very weak physically, and need self esteem and self confidence in that area, i need confidence with my body, which i am currently lacking i think, let's go for 3months gym membership with personal trainer with fix timing,

i need to write more and express more, i write very less and express my thoughts and learnings, i need to tweet more, write more blogs, document things more, i need to put more dots and connect things in obsidian

tezi wise direction, so currently one thing is slowing us down, which is smartagent, most of the tasks and other minor bugs are taken care by mohit, current bottleneck is mostly backend, so i need to optimize and make this scale easily, small small optimization and this things, and there are lots of anomaly in database side, so first need to fix that,

after smartagent heavy lifting is done, we need to push things on shopify side, nuxt mai theme choose kar di hai, sells representative wala plugin bana rahe the apne log, wo complete kar ke mast launch karna hai, and need to get early users, and by this, 

so for now this are on my top two list, and after 3 baje my other karan awakes, 
for him i have few ideas which i want to complete, first one is completing conway's game of life, then java chip 8 emulator, these two are on my top list, so let's complete this two first and then see where it leads


summary:
physically strong -> gym membership @3 months
writing -> write karo bhai more

go and slay
