Want to get things done, want to make progress, but either i am not putting enough efforts or not trying enough, i think i am distracted, and i am relying on motivation and inspiration which is not that much reliable, i need to avoid distraction and get into discipline and need to show up everyday no matter what happens, and i am not getting that much rejected which don't means i am optimizing for rejection but i am not trying enough or playing in my comfort zone,

i need to get this things in my schedule to get things done

gym, writing, rust, shipping projects and work
