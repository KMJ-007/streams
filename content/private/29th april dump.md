just saw a video of how sql and relation database industry went from 0 to go brrrr, how larry elision's decision were quite controversial but which helped him in unique way, from adopting c for portability, to supporting sql, where all other players were inventing and teaching their own query language, ibm didn't get to win despite of the main inventor and idea behind the relational query, they were too slow and too late, and not capturing the market properly, i didn't know mythical man month was written that early, and still holds it's value.

i am trying to to get into routine, playing around the times, which one fits the best, today i am changing the timing of gym, let's see how this goes, currently writing whatever is on my mind, need to go for de submission in clg, need to implement and complete the auth callback routes and make the shopify app installable today, yesterday took action to get more rusty, still i was very distracted and chatting with friends, one thing i have noticed or observed from many times is, i have become attention seeker, in one way or another, i am always trying to get someones attention, maybe reason is, i am feel lonely sometimes, i don't have anyone in my life, i need to tell other that i exist, i think that is one of the reason why i am in constant chase or efforts to get girlfriend, so i can have one who i can talk freely about my feelings, how i feel and tell, it's would be very false that seeking attention is very wrong thing, making it general statement would be wrong, talking about the current situation, i have got less attraction towards mahek nowdays, compare to the early days where i was constantly thinking about her, her exams are going on, and i am not disturbing her that much, i know no one is that busy to not reply text msg in day, what is the problem or issue here, is there any?, or are we just cooking things up in head, tbh, she is good looking, i like her smile, but in hot crazy matrix she fells into wife zone i think, only why i am trying is because she is not from computer background, she can think, she can take decisions own their own, and she is little rebellious, main idea behind going on date and starting to talk with other girls was, i am shy and i don't talk with girls and not aware about their world as much, and i think this one is skill, talking and handling women, and to get better i need to go through large repetition process, so that was the whole plan, so i get the idea of what is the game and what is the rules and am i interested in game in first place, got to know from other friend that she is interested in other guy, but still falling for her toxic ex, i think becoming blind aashique don't make sense, i have already msged her that we can't be friends, either date me or bye bye in good way, she is going to see that msg after her exam, one thing i understood is, i am not interested in one way thing, and i think it is better to close one door so another can open, but i think i have enough time to figure things out and there is no point of rushing, so for now, mahek is on the so called friend zone, i want to date but not one way, cool let's start the day!
