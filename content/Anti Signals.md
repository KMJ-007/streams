When we see people doing something and it start working for them on internet/irl, we try to imitate them or one can say try to catch the signals, but there is high chance that one will fail, because rather than catching signals we catch the anti signals, because they are the easiest one to fall for, it's like when signal is propagated to many times over the network, it looses it's value and it becomes anti signal, it's anti signal in disguise of signal.
